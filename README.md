# Repo Overview
## This repository contains implementations of linear regression and backpropagation algorithms from scratch in Python. The goal is to demonstrate fundamental machine learning concepts and techniques without relying on high-level libraries.

# Explanation
## Linear Regression Implementation:
## An awesome notebook that explains the gradient descent and weights updating process using MSE function with explanation of perprocessing the data
# Backpropagation Implementation (Iterative approach):
## Feed-forward neural network structure with a simple 2 layers network 
## Forward propagation and backward error propagation algorithms
## computing gradients of the network 
## updating weights function 
# Further additions:
## Adding predection function to the linear regression notebook 
## Adding gradient descent to Neural Network file with the predection function (you can check my repo for these two usig vectorized approach for NN)
